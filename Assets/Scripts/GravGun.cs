/* "Gravity Gun" script I quickly threw together to help another user out on Reddit.
 * When clicking the mouse button, you will grab a rigidbody object in front of the
 * main camera's view. 
 * Some initial information is recorded about where you grabbed the object, and
 * the difference between it's rotation and yours.
 * 
 * The object will be moved around according to the offset point you initially
 * picked up.
 * Moving around, the object will rotate with the player so that the player will
 * always be viewing the object at the same angle. 
 * 
 * 
 * Feel free to use or modify this script however you see fit.
 * I hope you guys can learn something from this script. Enjoy :)
